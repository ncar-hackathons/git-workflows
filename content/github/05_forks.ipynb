    "\"Forks\" are just clones hosted on GitHub, essentially.\n",

    "We have described the \"branch-merge\" technique already (in the Git section) for keeping multiple contributors from stomping on each other's work.  That technique works very well when everyone who is contributing has permissions to contribute to the repository.  However, for any number of reasons, constantly adding users as \"contributors\" (i.e., giving them permissions to write to the repository) may not be the most desirable thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for this is that all users who have _write_ permissions to the repository can directly push their changes to the repository.  And, as a good practice, all new changes to a repository should be _vetted_ (i.e., reviewed) by a trusted contributor.  You can do this with branches and merges using GitHub's \"Pull Request\" capability, but even then a full-fledged contributor can just merge their changes without review.  (Though you can set up your repository settings to require at least 1 reviewer before code is merged.  We won't go into that detail here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for this is because maintaining an up-to-date list of contributors to your code can be annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a third reason is because _you don't have to_!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?  Because of the \"Fork\" / \"Pull Request\" mechanism in GitHub."

There are a lot of things you can do here, such as click the \"Files changed\" tab to see what changes are actually going to be merged in (if this PR is accepted).  Or, in the \"Conversation\" tab, you can have a discussion about the changes that are being proposed.  Anyone with _write_ permissions to the main repository can merge your changes into the repository.  Though, they may ask you to make additional changes for any number of reasons.\n",

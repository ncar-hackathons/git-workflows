# What is Git? 

Well, if you don't know by now, Git is the Version Control System (VCS) used by GitHub.

repositories do not have a "central repository".  Or, rather, any copy of a Git repository
can be treated as the "central repository".  ...Or, to be even more complicated, there 
does not have to be central repository at all!

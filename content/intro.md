# Git & GitHub

Using a Version Control System (VCS) is one of the most powerful things that you can do
as a developer of any level, whether you are a casual developer "for fun" or you have to
develop for your job or you are a hard-core software engineer.  Version Control Systems
can _save your bum_ more than you like, certainly, but they can also be incredible
educational tools that help you see how software develops and changes over time.  There
is only one reason you should need to _always_ use a VCS for everything you do,
whether you are writing a paper for publication, writing a small scripts for seemingly
"one-off" tasks, or you are a full-fledged software engineer: a VCS will let you backtrack
your work when you realize you've made a mistake.  That is, as long as your work is
_text-based_ content, VCSes provide you with an "undo" button for reverting those mistakes
and getting back to a previous version.  _Git_ is one of those VCSes, and if you want
to use _GitHub_, it's the VCS you should use.

But why GitHub?  The answer is _open source software_ (OSS).

GitHub is a _hosting_ platform for your Git _repositories_ (_i.e._, the things that store
your version-controlled work).  GitHub is free, as long as your _repositories_ are open
and public.  GitHub provides powerful search capabilities so that you can find other
people's work on GitHub, and they can find yours.  And that encourages people to _share_
their work and ideas, which means that people don't constantly have to re-invent the 
wheel.  It also encourages collaboration and communication with people working on the
same things.  In other words, GitHub enables open source software.  Without something
like GitHub, OSS would be severely limited.

GitHub goes further than this, though, it also makes working with your Git respositories
easier and faster.  It deals with complications in Git that you (might) find annoying, and
makes them "push button."  

Together, Git and GitHub create a powerful platform that allows you take a tiny idea and
turn it into a community effort.

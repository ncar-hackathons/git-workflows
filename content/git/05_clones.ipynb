    "As I mentioned in the start of this section, I said that Git was a _distributed_ VCS, and I used the word _distributed_ as opposed to _centralized_ to mean that Git does not assume a centralized server hosting your Git repository.  That means that every \"copy\" of a Git repository is a self-sufficient repository of its own.\n",

    "Why couldn't we just do a simple `git push` like we could do a `git pull`?  Why did it have to get so complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that hase to do with how Git repositories are supposed to work, and how to keep them _safe_ from external _pushes_ while you are doing work in them.  Image that you were doing some work in your repository, and some one else cloned your repository and tried to push changes back into yours.  You might immediately see conflicts show up and other weird behaviors that might be hard to predict.  So, to prevent that scenario from happening, Git prevents you from _pushing_ changes into an existing repository if the branch into which the changes are being pushed has been checked out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to this complication is what we did above: you can push into a new branch, and create the branch \"on the fly.\"  Another solution is to make sure the `origin` repository is a _bare_ repository.  A _bare_ repository is, essentially, just the `.git` directory in your repository directory; that is, there is no place for files to be \"checked out,\" so there is no branch that can ever be checked out.  (To visualize this, instead of having our `my_project/.git` directory structure, imagine that we simply had `my_project.git`.)  As long as there are no branches checked out, there will never be any weird synching behavior when someone pushes their commits to the `origin` repository.  (Repositories on GitHub are all _bare_ repositories.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, though, it is usually much easier to just `pull`.  And you can set up the `origin` repository to have `fetch` capabilities from the clone repository.  Then, all you need to do is tell the owner of the `origin` repository that you have some changes they might want to `pull` into their repository.  This is called a _Pull Request_, and it is a procedure that is made incredibly easy by GitHub."
